# More Signs

## INT. OFFICE - DAY

We are TRAVELING with marker drawing a line on a whiteboard. The line ends with an arrowhead.

BACKING OUT from the arrow, we reveal a complex diagram, interspersed with boxes with ledgers like 'DEEP LEARNING', 'BLOCKCHAIN' an so on. There's something manic about it all.

The MAN FROM THE INTRO is standing in front of then board, well pleased and marker at the ready.

**MAN**

There we go, right? We can make this look like we're workshopping, like, very spontaneous.

\(looks out over room\)

You have the Office Lena app, Anna? Snap the board and post it in our LinkedIn feed.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A TABLE -- sits Anna with a laptop in front of her.

ANNA

Shall I call it our take on structure?

The man looks aghast and steps up to the table, punctuating in the air with his marker.

MAN

No, say that 'This constitutes our overarching architecture'.

Anna stares at him in share disbelief. 

Then suddenly she pushes her chair back so fast that it ripples over and she runs out of the room.

The man looks at the open door. After a beat he points towards it with the marker.

MAN

What the hell got into her?/is her problem?

INT. REST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna sends the door SLAMMING on its hinges and falls on her knees in front of the toilet. 

She just makes it before loud noises of SPLASHING and THROWING up is all we hear.
