INT. LIVING ROOM - ANNA'S APARTMENT - LATER

A wine glass stands empty in front of us, some red traces at its bottom and the background blurry through it. 

ANNA (O.C.)
Alexa, turn off the music.

And the music that was playing DIES.

AT THE SOFA -- we can see that the whole room is deserted now, save from Anna who is heavily plonking herself down in the sofa with all the abandoned wine glasses in front of her. 

A tinker bell TING echoes and Anna looks at her phone. 

ON THE SCREEN -- is a banner telling her that someone just posted something on Instagram.

BACK ON ANNA -- as she puts the phone down on the coffee table. 

ANNA
Alexa, read the latest Instagram post in my feed. 

The automated, half human, half machine voice is piped through her speakers. 

ALEXA (V.O.)
From Leah. As usual, the best evening with all the best girls at Anna's, exclamation mark. Three hearts. 

Quickly, Anna snaps forward as a jack knife and vomits over the coffee table.
