INT. LIVING ROOM - ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lounging in two sofas opposite each other in an open living room–kitchen area, are three of Anna's girlfriends LEAH, SOPHIE and SHANIA. 

Soft music is PLAYING, one bottle of wine on the coffee table is empty and another is being poured into their glasses, standing tall among bowls of assorted snacks. 

LEAH
...and then he just collapsed on top of me and – I kid you not! – within fourteen seconds he was snooring! 

The others ROAR with LAUGHTER. 

ANNA
Typical hipster behaviour, if you ask me. You need to stay away from excessive beards. 

SOPHIE
You mean the longer the beard, the louder the...?

More SNICKERING from all. 

ANNA
It's not so much the length or growth of the beard, as it is the _attention_ to it. Excessive attention is a clear warning sign. 

LEAH 
Ah, you mean those who pretend to go to pretend barbers? 

SOPHIE
What is a 'pretend' barber? 

LEAH
One who fashion their salon after what they've seen in Fifties movies. The places they imagine their grandfathers went to. 

ANNA
When in reality, they were buzzcut by their fathers with out on the lawn with a trimmer bought from a catalogue. 

SHANIA
But isn't it their turn now? 

SOPHIE
What do you mean? 

SHANIA
Well, we have gone to the salon to fix our hair since the 1030:s, so maybe this is what we get if we want things to be, like, _modern_ and all? 

They're all silent for a beat. Then they all CRACK UP. 

LEAH
As if!

ANNA
That's preposterous! 

SHANIA
Well, Lisa also collapses snoring, so I'm just saying!

Some LAUGH, some lean back in the sofa, shaking their head. Anna walks away to the kitchen area and returns with bowl of salsa that she puts down on the coffee table. 

SOPHIE
So what's this with your boss all about, Anna? 

SHANIA
Yeah, that sounded preposterous as well! 

ANNA
(shrugs)
I got a warning because I was sick. 

LEAH
What? They can't do that!

ANNA
I mean, I got physically sick. 

Some find this funny. 

ANNA
On a client. 

Another ROAR from the girls. 

LEAH
OK, that's slightly unheard of...

SHANIA
Yeah, but why? Did you eat something bad at lunch? 

ANNA
No, it was the weirdest thing. I just read this post on their LinkedIn. 

SOPHIE
What? 

LEAH
Are you serious? 

SHANIA
What did it say? Was it a horrible picture? 

They all look at Anna, who is contemplating something. 

ANNA
No, it wasn't any picture or anything else that was obviously bad. The only thing I can think of if I'm asked to see/find a pattern in all this, is that they we're lying.

Her friends say nothing. 

ANNA
(gestures with her hand)
I'm, it was an exaggeration on the wrong side of hyperbole. Like, you know the typical, insincere posting that people are starting to take for granted in social media. 

Leah is about to say something, but Anna interrupts. 

ANNA
You know how someone will say that this day is a fantastic time for change, how spring is wonderful or that a dinner was the best and the friends that they were with are the best and that the restaurant is _the_ best. Well, obviously everything can't be the best and especially not all the time. 
(a beat)
That's not how life works. That's not life. It's a lie. And it's an untruth that is poisoning real life. 

The girlfriends are taken aback by her outburst. Clearly they didn't expect it and they squirm uncomfortably in their sofas since they, at some level, feel critiqued. They are all guilty of the kind of posts that Anna describes. 

SOPHIE
OK, I hear you, I think. But how is this related to your work? And to your boss? 

LEAH
Yeah, you can't accuse Facebook and LinkedIn as social constructs for your own mistreatment of your clients, can you now? 

ANNA
Why not? 

SHANIA
Well, for one it's not their fault that the culture is what it is?

ANNA
(in affect)
_Isn't_ it? Aren't we all responsible for the atmosphere we create by what we do and write? 

They are all silent. Baffled. But Anna can't stop. 

ANNA
And what happens to our real life if we all portrait it by hyperbole?
