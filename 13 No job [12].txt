INT. OFFICE - DAY

Arriving at her office, Anna is met by the woman from the client meeting.

WOMAN
Good morning, Anna. We have to talk.

In the glass cage behind them, we can see Anna's boss busy with a phone call with her back to us.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We are back in the same conference room as before. (From the meeting.)

WOMAN
Have a seat.

Anna sits, still very unsure what this is about.

WOMAN
There's no easy way to say this so I'm just gonna come right out.
(a beat)
We are restructuring your department and as a result you will no longer have a role there.

ANNA
What?

WOMAN
Going forward, we don't think strategy is what we should be doing so much of. Especially with social media, we can use bots instead.

ANNA
Are you serious?

WOMAN
Unfortunately, I am. There's now this thing called programmatic...

Anna releases a LOUD SIGH.

WOMAN
...and this can be handled automatically by computers.

ANNA
As opposed to you, I know what programmatic is. And you can't seriously be considering letting computers do the strategy for something computers are selling?

The woman is non-plussed, as if not understanding a word of what Anna says.

ANNA
Programmatic is just the shit the media didn't manage to sell because people with _brains_ realised it was _shit_!

WOMAN
No need to be snooty. This is not my decision, I'm just the messenger.

ANNA
Of course it's not your decision, you fat cow!

INT. OUTSIDE ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

Anna is waiting at the elevators, big cartoon box filled with her stuff in her arms. She waits and she waits.

Then a loud DING and the elevator doors SWOOSH open. A middle-aged man step out with his eyes to the floor. He looks up at Anna, raising his eyebrows in surprise.

ANNA
Shut up!
