## INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Sitting behind a table and looking straight into camera with the exact same framing and distance as the previous scene, a middle-aged WOMAN with undulated hair with golden streaks in it is talking to us. 

**WOMAN**

The party Saturday evening was faaantastic! All our friends were there and Philippa was sooo funny. And the food...

\(grabs at something outside frame\)

Wait, let me show you some pictures.

\(holds a stack of big prints and show them one at a time\)

Here's the starter. Just look at the claws! And here's the salmon sashimi - delicious. And here's Philippa!



The woman collects all of the prints into a neat stack again, looking down absentmindedly at the table.

**WOMAN**

Yeah, it was sooo much fun, the party was. 

\(a beat\)

I just wonder why Philippa hasn't answered any...

She trails off, fiddling with the prints.
