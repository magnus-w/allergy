# Coffee Shop - Anna

## INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY



A layer of reflections with rays of light cutting through them, as if we were looking in through several layers of window pane. 

In a pool of light where one of the rays land, a ceramic coffee cup is sitting on a table, steam rising, curling up in the light. 



**ANNA \(O.S.\)**

I like it here. There's a calmness. The flow of time is slower.



On a small plate, a piece of bread gleams with marmalade. 



**ANNA \(O.S.\)**

I remember how happy I got when I first found it. 

\(a beat\) \)

I wasn't at a good place back then.



Behind a pane of reflecting glass, sandwiches and other items of artisan bakery glide by on parade. 



**ANNA \(O.S.\)**

It started with a simple slide deck. 



BEHIND A TABLE -- Anna, twenty-eight to thirty-ish with a quirky, interesting look, is reclining against the back of a wall mounted sofa. 



**ANNA**

At a meeting, I was asked to change the phrase 'send you a PDF' to 'we will deliver through our integrated, digital collaboration channel'.

\(a beat\)

Doesn't seem like such a big deal, right? It's just incredibly fucking pretentious and insincere. 



Anna LAUGHS and shakes her head.



**ANNA**

But I had to make a run for it. Very nearly didn't make it in time to the restroom. Threw up like a fountain. 

\(thinking about it\)

Yeah, that's what I did, alright.
