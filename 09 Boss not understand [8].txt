INT. GLASS OFFICE - DAY

In a swanker room than previous, Anna's BOSS is sitting behind a black, metal table dressed in a pant suit and with her hair pulled back in a bun. 

They are encased by walls of glass, so colleges can see them having the meeting. 

BOSS
You know it's totally OK to say it? I mean, I can't ask you about it, obviously. But there's nothing to worry about. We're a modern company with modern policies so can feel confident that if you say something, everything will be alright.

ANNA
Say what?

BOSS
(a warm smile)
Well, obviously I can't say what it is you should say...The policy hinders me from asking.
  

ANNA
Is this about the incident with MKB? 

BOSS
Yes, exactly! I mean, we totally understand if there's a bit of morning...

ANNA
(interrupts)
But that was in the afternoon?

BOSS
...this early on in your...

ANNA
(laughs)
No, no, that's not the _problem_! I'm not in a happy state!

BOSS
It would absolutely, positively _not_ be a problem! 

INT. OPEN PLAN SPACE - CONTINUOUS

From the open plan workspace outside, the office Anna and her boss is having the meeting in looks like a glass cage. 

Some COLLEAGUES walk by and exchange (sinister) glances.

ANNA (V.O.)
But I'm not. 

BOSS (V.O.)
But if you're not, how come...

INT. GLASS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The boss is leaning forward on her elbows, pressing the palms of her hands together with a concerned look.

BOSS
...you throw up all the time?

ANNA
I don't know.

BOSS
You don't know???

ANNA
No, I seriously don't know.

BOSS
What we do know is that it's starting to become a serious problem. 

She flicks through some papers on the desk in front of her.

ANNA
I thought you just said that...

BOSS
Elisabeth was none the happier for having that MKB meeting go tits up. Quite a steep dry cleaning bill she had to take care of there...

ANNA
Listen, obviously I understand that wasn't ideal. But I couldn't help it. It's almost like some kind of allergy.

BOSS
What kind of allergy?

ANNA
I don't know. If I knew what it was, this would be easy, wouldn't it?

BOSS
Well, whatever it is we can't have it, is that clear?

She gets up from her chair, announcing that the meeting is over.

BOSS
We can't have our most important clients getting puked on.


ANNA
Yes, but...

BOSS
Just sort it out.
